Added mrjobs for retweet rate computation and favorite rate computations.

Also added scripts to output degree distribution and usestats.

I believe we could use the retweet rate script to do something more useful.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify potential breakout tweets
\item Track the users involved in creating and propagating such breakout tweets
\item Use data on user involvement in breakout tweets on TwitterRank or some ranking system as edge weights
\end{enumerate}
