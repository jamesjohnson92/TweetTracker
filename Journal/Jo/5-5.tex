\section*{HOLY FUCK THE PRESENTATION IS IN TWO DAYS!}

We should try to get that lm done by then.
This requires, hopefully tonight,
1) Running TwitterRank
2) Running simple feature extration (Dilli's thing)
3) Running TweetTopics

That will give me 1.5 days to try a few linear regressions, either in R or using LAARDD.

Would be cool if we could get AlphaPhi working too, but that sounds ambitious (although we're super close, basically the code is down).

\section*{LDA improvements}

This is a TODO for me.  
I should modify GenerateCorpus and GenerateTweetCorpus to up-regulate hashtags, remove @mentions.
Also improve the stopwords file, probably someone has made one good for common english shittery on the interwobz.
For instance, im is a popular word but just means I'm and isn't a stopword.
