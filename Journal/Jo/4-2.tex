This is a lil journal system I like using.  
Basically, you put a new file whose name is the date (this one is April 2nd, that is, \texttt{4-2.tex}) with your journal entry.  
Then a composite pdf is generated from the python script \texttt{GenerateJournal.py}.  
Its simple and offline, so we still have a collaborative thing but without the annoyances of sharing a google doc.  
The pdf file could be generated during the pre-commit hook, if you like that sort of thing.
