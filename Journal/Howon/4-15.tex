More ideas on features should be thought of.

Temporal idea. Like the EKG of people, the natural life-span and shape of a retweet explosion.

Idea of possibly online way to normalize by amount of people looking at things: maybe NN, maybe SNN. Think of it as a possibly spiking continuous time. Or bucket it by hour.

Some preprocess thing to get best times for each region, easy passes for demographics, regional, time zone, language, followers

Starting with a rank, we would look at content, follower list, retweets.

Three classes of features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Static, generic features
\item Shortly after the tweet happens features (history features).
\item Something else: ex: some guy who rarely retweets retweeted you, or the time between retweets decreases exponentially
\end{enumerate}

Note: We should identify some breakout tweets

Two things. First, what makes a tweet breakout (do we have a good definition)? Second, look at the graph to let more things come to our minds and write some code that goes through the tweets.
