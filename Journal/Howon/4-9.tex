Notes from Jeff

We should seriously consider taking only a few of the topics, for the same reason the Twitterrank people (for parameter reduction). But you might also think about the combination of what people tweet about and the person themselves.

That is, there might be some relation between what a person's followers are and what they tweet about. Eg., the second part of the Twitterrank thing, with the PageRank and weighting.
