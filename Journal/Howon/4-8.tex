\begin{enumerate}
\item Email the guy about getting the graph data, so we can actually sample the users and we need that graph for other stuff
\item Maybe do an actual sample to think about distributions myself to unbias the tweets (maybe we're ok with just getting people who tweet more?)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}

Work on implementation of the TwitterRank and the topic distributions. \\

Brainstorming. \\

Some ideas may be worse than others. \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item We could have more users
\item We could construe each tweet as a separate document
\item Think of a 3-layer bayes net, where user has distribution over topics and the tweet has distribution over topics where prior is over user's distribution over topics.
\item Find a user that does poorly in twitterrank even though they do well in real life or in our algo (someone strong in 2 different fields)
\item What if we pick our own topics, and do actual labelling?
\item Syntax? Stop words? Use NLTK
\item Can we reconstruct the retweeting graph and do everything in the proposal first?
\end{enumerate}
